# UnsplashPhotoViewerApp

An Android app utilising the Unsplash API. 

This app makes requests to the API using Retrofit2 and allows users to view photos as staggered grid view, click on photos to see details (user information, number of likes, etc) and navigate directly to the content creator's personal Unsplash page.
